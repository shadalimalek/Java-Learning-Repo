// ðŸ”· STEP 2: Instance Variables â€” (also called object variables)
// ðŸ“˜ What are they?
// Declared inside a class, but outside methods.

// Every object has its own copy of these variables.

// Used to store data for objects.

// They can be accessed using the object (objectName.variableName).
