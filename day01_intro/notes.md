# ☕ Day 01 – Introduction to Java

Welcome to your Java journey!

---

## 🔹 What is Java?

Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language created by Sun Microsystems in 1995.  
It is used for:

- Android app development 📱
- Web applications 🌐
- Desktop software 🖥️
- Enterprise systems 🏢
- Games like Minecraft 🎮

Java runs on the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**, which makes it **platform-independent**.  
You write Java code once and run it anywhere (Windows, Mac, Linux).

## ⚙️ How Java Works (Simplified Flow)

1. You write code in a `.java` file  
2. You compile it using `javac` → it creates a `.class` bytecode file  
3. JVM runs the `.class` file using `java` command

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts (You’ll Learn Over Time)

- Java is **strictly typed** (you must define variable types)
- Every program starts from the `main()` method
- Code must be inside a `class`
- Statements end with `;`
- Java is case-sensitive

## 📂 Our Learning Structure

This course is organized **day-by-day** — each folder teaches 1 topic:

day01_intro/
day02_basics/
day03_variables/
day04_operators/
...


Each folder includes:
- ✅ Source code (`.java` files)
- ✅ Notes (`notes.md`)
- ✅ Explanations + examples

## ✅ Today’s Goal

By the end of Day 1, you will:
- Understand what Java is and why it's useful
- Know how Java code runs
- Write your first Java program (`HelloWorld.java`)

Let's get started 🚀  
➡️ Next: [HelloWorld.java](./HelloWorld.java)
