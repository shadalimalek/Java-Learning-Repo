# ☕ Day 01 – Introduction to Java + Hello World

Welcome to your Java journey! This repo is a day-by-day learning log — for both you and anyone starting from zero.

## 🔹 What is Java?

Java is a **high-level**, **object-oriented**, and **platform-independent** programming language created by Sun Microsystems in 1995.

You can use Java to build:

- 📱 Android apps  
- 🌐 Web apps (backend servers)  
- 🖥️ Desktop software  
- 🏢 Enterprise systems (banking, insurance, logistics)  
- 🎮 Games like Minecraft  

It’s one of the most widely used languages in the world.

## ⚙️ How Java Works (Simplified Flow)

Here’s how a Java program runs:

1. You write code in a `.java` file  
2. You compile it using the `javac` command  
   → This creates a `.class` file (bytecode)  
3. The JVM (Java Virtual Machine) runs this bytecode using the `java` command

This makes Java **cross-platform**. You write once, and it runs anywhere that has a JVM.

## 🧠 Key Java Concepts (That You'll Learn)

- Java is **strictly typed** → you must declare variable types (`int`, `String`, etc.)
- Every Java program starts from the `main()` method
- All code must be inside a `class`
- Statements end with a `;` (semicolon)
- Java is **case-sensitive** (`Main` ≠ `main`)
- Uses **camelCase** for naming variables and methods

## 📂 How This Repo Is Structured

This repo is organized by **day-wise folders**, where each day teaches a specific topic.

Example:
day01_intro/
├── HelloWorld.java
└── notes.md

day02_basics/
├── SyntaxExamples.java
└── notes.md

day03_variables/
...


Each folder contains:
- ✅ Java source code with comments  
- ✅ Markdown notes (like this file)  
- ✅ Concepts, examples, and explanations  

All backed by Git commits and short-form video lessons.

## ✅ What You’ll Learn Today (Day 01)

By the end of today, you will:

- Understand **what Java is** and where it's used  
- Know **how Java programs run** using the JVM  
- Write and run your first Java file: `HelloWorld.java`

---

## 👇 Your First Program: Hello World

Open and run this file:  
👉 [`HelloWorld.java`](./HelloWorld.java)

You’ll learn:
- How Java classes work  
- What the `main()` method is  
- How to print text using `System.out.println()`  
- How to compile + run your first `.java` file from the terminal

---

✅ Once you're done, you're officially a Java programmer. Even if it's just one line — you’ve started.  
➡️ On to [Day 02: Java Syntax & Output](../day02_basics/notes.md)

Let’s go 🚀
